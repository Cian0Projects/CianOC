During my work on my final year project in college I developed a novel deep autoencoder approach for damage detection on a real bridge. This work significantly contributes to the field of structural health monitoring in that the ML model was successfully able to detect progressive damage on this real bridge. Typically, these studies are conducted in idealised laboratory environments or through numerical simulations, however this study highlights the capability of using machine learning to detect damage in a real bridge when noise present in the data is accounted for correctly. Hopefully someday this gets published in an academic journal!
