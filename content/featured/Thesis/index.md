My final year Masters' thesis titled - 'Developing Machine Learning Damage Detection Algorithms for
Structural Health Monitoring of a Real Bridge'. Successfully detected progressive damage on a real
bridge using accelerometer data attached to a recently decommisioned bridge. Developed novel techniques
to improve research in the field of structural health monitoring.
