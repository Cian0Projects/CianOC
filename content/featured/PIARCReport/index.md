I was involved in a conducting a research report on 'AI in the Road Sector' during my time on work placement at Roughan & O'Donovan. This work was done on behalf of PIARC, with the aim of informing road authorities around the world of the future outlook for the use of AI. The report covers a wide range of applications and my work included a literature review, stakeholder engagement and finalising drafts of the report. This work gained significant global traction, a preview of the report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1gXLfOXUfiVTIs_pqjyDfbwMFjkSYR2/view?usp=drive_link), and the full report can be found [here](https://www.piarc.org/en/order-library/46418-en-Artificial%20Intelligence%20in%20the%20Road%20Sector) on the PIARC website.
